				<h1>Welcome to Taggr</h1>
				<h2>What's this?</h2>
				<p>
					It's an app for when you're researching the visual style of something. Sort of like Pinterest, but
					using google image search, and much faster.
				</p>
				<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
				<p>
					On the next page, do a search. If you're just trying this out, I suggest "modern fireplace" and
					imagine you're researching for your next big home renovation project.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then add a tag or two at the bottom of the screen. Maybe "mantle", "tile" or any other way you might
					categorize your findings.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now this is the part that makes this so much faster than Pinterest. Scroll through the results, and
					if you like something, hover over it and press the number key on your keyboard that corresponds with
					the tag you want to tag it with.
				</p>
				<h2>Why?</h2>
				<p>I thought it would be cool and useful? But also because I wanted to show off my React skills.</p>
				<h2>Who?</h2>
				<p>
					This app was design and built by Chris Silich.
